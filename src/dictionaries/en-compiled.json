The challenge was to ensure seamless execution across multiple time zones, with different marketing teams managing the campaign in each region. The solution needed to be implemented and delivered quickly, be accessible to non-technical personnel, and require minimal technical support from developers. We built a promo banner using HTML, CSS, and JS, then injected it into each website via Google Tag Manager, allowing each marketing team to enable or disable it instantly. The banner automatically adjusted based on real-time user progress data (Front-end) and fetched promo type, conditions, and styling customizations from an AWS database (Back-end), which was updated through a Google Spreadsheet (Content Management System). This allowed the distributed teams to manage the campaign independently and timely, reducing errors and enabling smooth execution."
