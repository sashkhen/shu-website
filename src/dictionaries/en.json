    "defaultMessage": "I started my career as an HTML/CSS developer, working on internal projects within a Back-end team at an outsourcing company. I quickly moved on to client projects, learned React, and joined a major Healthcare platform project, which became my primary focus for the next two years. This experience taught me the importance of code quality and team collaboration. I explored technologies like Ruby on Rails and Vue, and developed a deep appreciation for good design. But what stood out most was the incredible team of talented, passionate individuals who showed me what it means to truly love your work."

I worked on fast-paced MVPs built with ES5, jQuery, Google Docs API, Firebase, <mistake>and hacking Angular</mistake>, as well as long-term projects using React, Vue, ES6, AWS, CI/CD, and more."

  "experience.lc.project": {
    "defaultMessage": "My favorite ever project was a Black Friday promo banner campaign for a retail client. The challenge was to ensure seamless execution across multiple time zones, with different marketing teams managing the campaign in each region. The solution needed to be implemented and delivered quickly, be accessible to non-technical personnel, and require minimal technical support from developers. We built a promo banner using HTML, CSS, and JS, then injected it into each website via Google Tag Manager, allowing each marketing team to enable or disable it instantly. The banner automatically adjusted based on real-time user progress data (Front-end) and fetched promo type, conditions, and styling customizations from an AWS database (Back-end), which was updated through a Google Spreadsheet (Content Management System). This allowed the distributed teams to manage the campaign independently and timely, reducing errors and enabling smooth execution."

Despite the fast pace and ever-changing market, they remained driven by their vision and commitment to pushing boundaries. The projects we worked on allowed me to execute precisely on a clearly defined scope of features, and also, when requirements were more vague, exercise my own judgment to deliver working prototypes. This balance was only possible because of the clear communication around what was important and the trust in my professional ability to make decisions on the rest. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that taught me to be adaptable and proactive while working alongside an incredibly dedicated and talented team."

It was an environment where growth and creativity thrived, driven by the need to stay agile and find the best solutions in a fast-paced setting. Working alongside such a driven and skilled team not only enhanced my technical abilities but also reinforced the importance of flexibility, problem-solving, and collaboration."

As the project evolved, I took on a broader range of responsibilities, from developing new features and troubleshooting bugs to addressing technical debt and contributing to refactoring efforts, all while ensuring code quality through unit and end-to-end testing.
